# **Data Analysis with R Programming**
---
_Let's start by loading a dataset to work with. We can use the palmer penguins dataset, which contains size measurements for three penguin species that live on the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. This includes data on stuff like body mass, flipper length and bill length. The dataset has 344 rows of information sorted into eight columns. The palmer penguins data is popular with analysts and is great for fun exploration, visualization and teaching concepts_.

Bill dimensions
The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird‚Äôs bill. In the simplified penguins data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to be more intuitive.

For this penguin data, the culmen (bill) length and depth are measured as shown below :
